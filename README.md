# üåü Motivational Quote Bot üöÄ

Welcome to the **Motivational Quote Bot**! This simple yet powerful bot generates daily motivational quotes using **OpenAI's GPT-3** and posts them to **Twitter**. It's the perfect way to keep your Twitter feed filled with positive vibes and hustle energy. Let's get inspired, one tweet at a time! üí™

## üéØ Purpose

The bot's goal is to:
- Generate unique, tweet-length motivational quotes.
- Use OpenAI‚Äôs powerful GPT-3 model for crafting custom content.
- Post these quotes automatically to your Twitter account.
- Inspire and energize Gen Z & Millennials, especially from the urban hustle in **Kenya**. üåç

### Key Features
- **AI-powered Motivational Quotes**: Generated by OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3 model, the quotes are tailored for urban African millennials.
- **Twitter Integration**: The bot posts directly to your Twitter account via Tweepy.
- **Customizable**: You can tweak the style of quotes or adjust the post frequency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: The language we used to build the bot.
- **OpenAI API**: The engine that generates the quotes using GPT-3.
- **Tweepy**: Python library to interact with the Twitter API.
- **GitHub Actions**: To automate the posting of tweets at a scheduled time.

## üí° Getting Started

To set up the bot, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies

You'll need a few Python libraries to get started. Install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install openai tweepy

2. Set Up API Keys
Before running the bot, you need to add your API keys for OpenAI and Twitter.

OpenAI: Create an account on OpenAI and generate an API key.

Twitter: Go to the Twitter Developer Portal, create a new app, and get your API keys and tokens.

Set up the following environment variables:
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY="your_twitter_consumer_key"
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET="your_twitter_consumer_secret"
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_twitter_access_token"
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="your_twitter_access_token_secret"
You can use .env files or any method of your choice to manage these secrets.

3. Running the Bot
Once the environment variables are set, run the Python script:

python post_quote.py
This will generate a motivational quote and post it to your Twitter account.

4. Automate with GitHub Actions
To automate this process, we use GitHub Actions to schedule tweets at specific intervals. Below is an example .github/workflows/bot.yml configuration file:
name: Post Motivational Quotes

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * *"  # Runs every day at 9:00 AM UTC

jobs:
  post_quote:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run Bot
        run: |
          python post_quote.py
This will run the bot every day at 9:00 AM UTC.

üõ†Ô∏è Code Explanation
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what the code does:

Generate Quotes with OpenAI:

The generate_quote() function creates a motivational quote by prompting OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3 model to craft a quote based on specific themes: Kenyan hustle, self-worth, purpose, and more.

Post to Twitter with Tweepy:

The bot uses the Tweepy library to authenticate with Twitter and post the generated quote as a tweet.

Environment Variables:

Sensitive API keys for both OpenAI and Twitter are stored in environment variables to keep them secure.

üöß Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues like RateLimitError, it may be due to exceeding the API usage quota. You can handle this gracefully by implementing retry logic with exponential backoff or adjusting your API usage frequency.
